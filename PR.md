# Project Requirements (PR.md)

## Project Overview

A Proof of Concept (POC) for a live blog application that demonstrates modern React and Next.js performance optimization techniques with real-time content updates.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Live Blog Interface**: Display a continuous feed of mixed content types (news, social posts, events)
- **Real-time Updates**: Configurable polling mechanism (default: 60 seconds)
- **Infinite Scroll**: Seamless content loading as user scrolls
- **Lazy Loading**: Load additional post details when posts become visible in viewport
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Remove off-screen content from DOM and replace with skeletons
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintain smooth UX even with large amounts of content

### Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with Partial Pre-rendering (PPR)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for caching and state management
- **Modern React**: Leverage React 18+ concurrent features
- **Viewport Detection**: Intersection Observer API for visibility tracking
- **Memory Management**: DOM cleanup for off-screen content

### Content Management

- **Mixed Content Types**: Support different post formats (text, images, metadata)
- **Two-tier Loading**:
  1. Initial post data (title, summary, timestamp)
  2. Detailed content loaded on viewport entry
- **API Integration**: Use free external APIs to simulate real data sources

### Performance Constraints

- **Viewport-based Loading**: Content loads when visible + preload margin
- **DOM Efficiency**: Minimize DOM nodes for better browser performance
- **Smooth Scrolling**: No jank during infinite scroll operations
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient cleanup of unused content

### User Experience

- **No Styling Focus**: Basic, functional UI without design emphasis
- **Responsive Behavior**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during data fetching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for API failures

## Non-Requirements

- Complex UI/UX design
- User authentication
- Content creation/editing
- Real-time WebSocket connections
- SEO optimization beyond PPR basics
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Accessibility features (for POC scope)

## Success Criteria

1. Smooth infinite scroll with 1000+ posts
2. Sub-100ms response time for viewport-based loading
3. Memory usage remains stable during extended use
4. Polling works reliably with configurable intervals
5. Clean separation of concerns in codebase
6. Demonstrable performance benefits from React 18 features
